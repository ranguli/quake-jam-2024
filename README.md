# Quake Yam Setup

It is very important to RTFM to avoid fear, confusion, delirium, etc.

_If you want to have fun mapping, avoid frustration, and achieve any level of success, sit down and spend plenty of time just learning TrenchBroom and getting a feel for how it works BEFORE you set out to make your epic map. If you aren't comfy enough with TrenchBroom before you try and build your masterpiece you're not gonna be able to easily translate the ideas in your head into a map and you will have a bad time. Start small and don't be overly ambitious until you know your way around TrenchBroom._


## Getting Started

#### Opening an existing map in TrenchBroom
Follow this [Wiki article](https://github.com/ranguli/quake-jam-2024/wiki/Opening-an-existing-map-in-TrenchBroom). Note that many of the steps for opening a map will also be applicable when you _create_ a new map,
so it's worth reading. Plus, being able to open a map will let you test your TrenchBroom setup, especially your compilation settings.
